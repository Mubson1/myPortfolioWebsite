                    Technology has become an important requirement in every activity we perform. The way of teaching and learning has been changing with the
                    development of technology. The education life that existed just a decade ago is now in another different level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technology is not just being used in college life, but also in the grade school. A report published by 
                    <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/zero-eight-childrens-media-use-america/key-finding-1%3A-young-children-use-digital
                    -media-frequently"><i style="font-size: 20px; color: rgb(233, 145, 31);">Common Sense Media</i></a> states that the use of computer is
                    extensive among young children. About 53% of children with age group from 2 to 4 and about 90% of children with age group from 5 to 8
                    have used the computer. So, the growth in the use of computer among students or children has incresed in exponential rate. Students can 
                    access the education platform through their smartphones, laptops, social networking and so on.

            <div class="card2">
                <h2>Easy access to education resources</h2>
                <p>
                    With the development of technology, resources can easily be accesssed through internet. Every study materials and beyond that, can be
                    found in internet. School or college id can be used to visit online library, online teaching and so on. By connecting with online groups
                    and teachers, the learning process can be very easy. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card2">
                <h2 style="color: rgb(233, 145, 31);">Technology encourages self learning</h2>
                <p>
                    One major impact on education is that students are developing a habit of self=learning. The resources are available in the technology
                    only. In traditional education system, students have to match the pace of teacher's teaching. But with the technological development, 
                    they can access the study resources at any given time. The research skills are being developed due to it.
                </p>

            <div class="card2">
                <h2 style="color: rgb(233, 145, 31);">Technology promotes creative learning</h2>
                <p>
                    As same medicine can't be given to patients with different disease, one type of learning can't be good for other students. So, technology 
                    offers various options for the students to study. Video recording, group project, online study, research are some of these options that 
                    a student can through technology. Students that are interested in other subject instead of their courses can learn them. This increases 
                    the creativity in students.Likewise, teachers can also access student's understanding of course through technology and adjust the pace 
                    and method of teaching.

                <h2>Technology helps in student's engagement</h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, one method of teaching is not understandable by every students. So, if students can get their favourable method of
                    learning, the studying time becomes easier and more engaged. Technology also helps to develop a better interaction between teacher and 
                    learner. As fun and engaging as it is to play a quiz in classroom, technology also does the same. Instead of memorizing facts, students 
                    can learn through educational games, virtual field trip, science practicals, simulation tools,. This way, technology helps to increase 
                    the engagement of studetns in learning.

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Technology has impacted not just the daily life, but also education. By integrating the technology with study, a better engagement, 
                    productivity and learning can be achieved. Due to technology, we are not just limied to the course contents but also to many subjects
                    that we want to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As helpful as technology is in education, still many students have not been able to take its full advantage. There are some threat of 
                    teachnology like addiction, poronography, etc. But the technology don't have to be a distraction, if used properly. Technology offers a 
                    lot more and the learning becomes lot more fun and easy with its use.
